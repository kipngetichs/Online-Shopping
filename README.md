# Optimizing Online Shopping Sales: Data-Driven Insights and Strategies from a Comprehensive E-commerce Analysis
# Situation
Online shopping has become an integral part of modern commerce, offering convenience and reliability for customers. For entrepreneurs venturing into e-commerce, understanding sales trends and customer preferences is crucial. To provide actionable insights, I analyzed the Online Shopping Sales Dataset from Kaggle, which includes eight interconnected tables such as orders, customers, and suppliers. The aim of this analysis was to uncover patterns, seasonal trends, and supplier performance to optimize sales processes and delivery efficiency. This dataset offered a comprehensive view of the e-commerce landscape, enabling a data-driven approach to solving business challenges.
# Task
The objective of this analysis was to extract valuable insights from the dataset to identify top-selling products, evaluate transaction and shipment statuses, assess supplier performance, and uncover seasonal order trends. My task also involved exploring reasons behind these trends to provide clarity on the factors influencing sales performance. The ultimate goal was to produce a thorough analysis for stakeholders and entrepreneurs to better understand customer behavior and operational efficiency.
# Action
I began by importing the dataset into SQL Server, where I cleaned and standardized the data for analysis. Using SQL inner joins, I merged related tables to establish relationships and uncover deeper insights. After performing exploratory data analysis in SQL, I transferred the cleaned data to Power BI to create visualizations that highlighted key sales trends, shipment statuses, and product performance. Finally, I conducted a detailed examination of patterns and anomalies to understand their underlying causes, ensuring accurate interpretation of the data.The preview of the dashboard is available below.

# Result
The analysis revealed critical insights into online shopping trends as follows:
- Top-performing products included 4K Monitors, Standing Desks, Air Purifiers, and Microphones, reflecting the needs of remote workers and content creators. 
- Payment analysis showed that 80% of transactions were successful, while 10% were pending and 10% failed due to processing issues or customer dissatisfaction. 
- Shipment data indicated that delivered orders contributed $20.5M of total revenue, with pending and canceled orders highlighting areas for improvement. 
- Product category analysis showed Electronics leading with $20.4M in sales, followed by Home & Kitchen, Accessories, and Furniture. 
- Seasonal trends revealed peak order months in January, March, July, August, and October, with demand spikes varying by product category.
# Recommendations
- To address issues in pending and failed transactions, it is crucial to improve the efficiency of payment systems and establish clear communication with customers regarding transaction statuses. Providing detailed error feedback and offering alternative payment methods can reduce failed transactions and enhance customer trust.

- For shipments, it is recommended to streamline logistics by partnering with reliable carriers and leveraging tracking systems to minimize delays. Identifying bottlenecks in the shipment process, such as peak season overloads, and scaling resources during these periods can help address pending and canceled shipments effectively.

- To maintain consistent product performance, entrepreneurs should consider promoting top-performing products like 4K Monitors and Air Purifiers during peak months. Additionally, introducing targeted marketing campaigns for underperforming product categories, such as Furniture, can drive sales in these segments.

- Seasonal trends should inform inventory planning and promotional strategies. For example, increasing stock levels of Electronics in March and Accessories in January can meet heightened demand, preventing stockouts. Predictive analytics can also help forecast future trends, ensuring optimal preparation for seasonal fluctuations.

- Supplier optimization is another area of focus. Building stronger relationships with high-performing suppliers like Next Level Systems and negotiating better terms can ensure a consistent supply chain. Encouraging low-performing suppliers to improve by providing feedback and setting performance benchmarks can boost overall efficiency.

By addressing these recommendations, entrepreneurs and stakeholders can optimize operational processes, enhance customer satisfaction, and achieve sustainable growth in the competitive e-commerce market.
# Reflection
Through this analysis, I have gained a deeper understanding of how data can reveal valuable insights into e-commerce operations, including sales trends, customer behavior, and supplier performance. Personally, I have improved my skills in SQL for data cleaning and joining tables, as well as using Power BI for visual storytelling. This project has taught me the importance of identifying patterns, addressing operational inefficiencies, and tailoring recommendations to meet business objectives. Additionally, I learned how to balance technical accuracy with clarity when presenting findings to different audiences. This experience has enhanced my confidence in solving real-world business problems through data analytics
